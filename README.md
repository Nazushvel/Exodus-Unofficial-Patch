1. Keep as close to the format of the original file. This helps with future patches as well as creating the patches
2. If the issue was first pointed out by another user or COB fix please give credit.

### Preparing to apply patch
Follow these steps in order patch.

All files need to be lowercase. I have done this as it helps resolve case sensitivity problems with unix systems as well as it helps the patch find files. I have confirmed this does not cause issues in game.

Add all files into the marked folders. IE. creatures3 and dockingstation only the folders are needed. IE. `Backgrounds Body Data Bootstrap`

Run the `./patcher.sh` script in order to patch things. 

#### Note this is a work in progress
This is a work in progress and is not ready for much use yet.

The plan is to add Windows support as well its just not there yet.
